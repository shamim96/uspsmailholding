                uspsmailholding.com is operated by a private company which is not a government website, nor is it affiliated with, endorsed, or approved by the USPS or any government agency. uspsmailholding.com offers a service that specializes in providing assistance with scheduling and placing a hold mail request that the USPS cannot accommodate, while simultaneously offering customers ancillary benefits. All services include experienced and helpful support, available through our contact form. The fee we charge is in exchange for the services and benefits we provide, not for the actual hold mail request itself. The USPS service for holding mail can be filed for free online at usps.com or at a local post office if you prefer to file your own, although certain scheduling restrictions may apply.
            </p>
                <p>
                We reserve the right to investigate any and all suspected violations of these Terms of Use and to take any and all necessary or appropriate actions to remedy such violations, as we may determine in our sole discretion.

                </p>
                <h3>
                HOLD MAIL REQUESTS
                </h3>
                <p>
                In order to use the services provided, users must properly complete and submit the hold mail request consistent with the hold mail form requirements of the USPS. It is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that all information submitted is accurate, complete and consistent with the online hold mail form requirements of the USPS. uspsmailholding.com will attempt to process a hold mail request using the exact information provided by the user. If a hold mail request is made to this service with incorrect, inconsistent or incomplete information, uspsmailholding.com reserves the right to make necessary adjustments when reasonable, or to entirely refrain from completing the request. When applicable, we will make our best efforts to reach out to the customer to rectify any uncompleted requests.
                </p>
                <p>
                Once the user has submitted the information through our system, uspsmailholding.com will immediately attempt to complete their request. Once the hold mail request has been finalized and confirmed, any and all issues arising from the hold mail request are no longer the responsibility of uspsmailholding.com.
                </p>
                <p>
                The hold mail request will apply to all mail for the specified address. If you are looking to hold only a certain individual’s mail at the provided address, we advise that you do not use this service.
                </p>
                <p>
                Mail holds are not available for PO boxes.
                </p>
                <p>
                A hold mail confirmation email from the USPS confirms that a hold has been confirmed with the USPS for the address provided. uspsmailholding.com uses the email address provided by its customers to place hold mail requests with the USPS. This provides the customer with the correct information if changes are needed on their hold mail requests.
                </p>
                <p>
                A hold mail period is deemed to begin on the ‘start date’ with mail being returned, or ready for pickup, on the ‘end date’. An extension to the end date of a mail hold is only obtainable if the request for the extension is made prior to the end date. Once the hold mail request period has begun, no further extensions to the start date can or will be put into effect. Further, an edit request to adjust the accumulated mail collection option from “carrier” to “pickup,” or vice versa, must be made prior to the end date if the change is to have any effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                The USPS hold mail period can last for up to thirty days. Customers who have requested multiple consecutive mail holds in an effort to extend the thirty day limit are cautioned that accumulated mail from the initial request will not continue to be held by virtue of a second consecutive hold mail request. While uspsmailholding.com offers the option of making multiple mail hold requests at once, the responsibility to attend to the accumulated mail stays with the customer at the end of every mail hold period.
                </p>
                <p>
                If there is already an active mail hold on your address that was not placed by uspsmailholding.com, we do not have access to cancel that request and are not able to put on a new mail hold until that active hold is either cancelled, or we have reached the end of the hold dates. It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure that any active hold mail requests are cancelled or to provide us with the end dates of the existing hold, so that we may process the new hold mail request through uspsmailholding.com. If we cannot schedule a hold mail request because there is an existing active hold, and we have not received the details of the existing hold, uspsmailholding.com will not be held responsible in any way for not scheduling such a hold mail request.
                </p>
                <p>
                uspsmailholding.com is only a service provider. We do not hold any physical items for customers. We only assist in putting mail services on hold. As such, we are not responsible for any non-delivery of items after the mail hold period has ended. If your mail hold period, as so requested, has ended and regular delivery has not restarted, we are in no way answerable or accountable for this unrelated occurrence and will not make any further inquiry or take any further action on the matter. If you cannot locate or have not received your accumulated mail at the conclusion of the mail hold period, or if regular delivery has not recommenced, please contact your local post office.
                </p>

                CANCELLATION OF A HOLD MAIL REQUEST
                </h3>
                <p>
                To cancel a hold mail request prior to the start date, users should reference the Contact Us page to find the best way to contact us and inform of us of a cancellation request. Please refer to the Refunds section for further details on our refund policy. Once a hold mail request with uspsmailholding.com has been cancelled, we are not required to provide any further service or take any further action on your behalf.
                </p>
                <p>
